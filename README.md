# gispect

A terminal UI for inspecting git diffs side-by-side: old code on the left with
removed lines marked, new code on the right with added lines marked, plus a
changed-files panel, switchable diff modes, a built-in MCP server, and
self-update from the upstream repository.

## Install

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/bukomp/gispect
```

Or from a checkout: `cargo install --path .`

The upstream URL used for update checks is embedded at build time; override it
with the `GISPECT_REPO_URL` environment variable, either at build time or at
runtime.

## Usage

```sh
gispect                 # TUI, comparing the current branch against main/master
gispect --base develop  # choose the base branch
gispect --repo ~/src/x  # inspect another repository
gispect update          # check upstream for new commits and reinstall
gispect mcp             # run as an MCP server over stdio
```

## Diff modes

Cycle with `m`:

| Mode | Comparison |
|---|---|
| branch vs base | merge-base of the base branch vs `HEAD` (`git diff base...HEAD`) |
| working tree vs HEAD | everything not yet committed |
| staged | index vs `HEAD` (`git diff --cached`) |
| unstaged | working tree vs index (`git diff`) |

## Keys

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `j` / `k`, `↓` / `↑` | select file |
| `J` / `K`, `PgDn` / `PgUp`, `Ctrl-d` / `Ctrl-u` | scroll diff |
| `n` / `N` | jump to next / previous change; jumps to next / previous search match instead while a search is active |
| `g` / `G` | top / bottom of diff |
| `h` / `l`, `←` / `→` | horizontal scroll |
| `m` | cycle diff mode |
| `c` | toggle compact view — hide alignment filler rows so each pane reads contiguously |
| `s` | toggle syntax highlighting |
| `b` | cycle base branch |
| `r` | reload |
| `/` | search code in the current file's diff |
| `S` | search code across all changed files |
| `p` | filter the file panel by file/folder name |
| `U` | apply available update and restart into the new version |
| `?` | help overlay |
| `q` / `Esc` | quit |

## Search

- `/` searches within the currently selected file's diff. While a search is
  active, `n` / `N` jump to the next / previous match instead of the next /
  previous change hunk, and `Esc` clears the search.
- `S` searches across every changed file and opens a results popup listing
  `path:line: content` for each match. `j` / `k` move the selection, `Enter`
  opens the selected match — jumping to that file and line with the query
  still highlighted — and `Esc` closes the popup.
- `p` filters the file panel to files/folders whose path contains the typed
  text (case-insensitive substring match), updating live as you type. `Enter`
  keeps the filter applied; `Esc` clears it.
- All searches are smart-case: an all-lowercase query matches
  case-insensitively, while a query containing an uppercase letter matches
  case-sensitively.

## MCP server

`gispect mcp` speaks JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio (newline-delimited). Example
client configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gispect": {
      "command": "gispect",
      "args": ["--repo", "/path/to/repo", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Tools (all accept `mode`: `branch` | `working` | `staged` | `unstaged`,
default `working`, and `base` for `mode=branch`):

- `list_changed_files` — changed files with status and add/delete counts
- `get_file_diff` — unified diff of one file (`path` required)
- `diff_summary` — file count, total additions/deletions, per-status counts

## Self-update

`build.rs` embeds the commit hash the binary was built from. `gispect update`
(or the background check in the TUI, surfaced as an `UPDATE AVAILABLE` banner —
press `U`) runs `git ls-remote <repo-url> HEAD`; when upstream has new commits
it reinstalls via `cargo install --git <repo-url> --force`, which replaces the
binary in `~/.cargo/bin` — so it works for `cargo install`-ed binaries too.
Requires `git` and `cargo` on `PATH`. Binaries built from a tree without
commits report `unknown` and always offer the update. Applying the update from
the TUI (`U`) restarts gispect in place on the new binary with the same
arguments; `gispect update` from the CLI reinstalls and exits.
